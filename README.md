# UFO Sightings

## Overview
In this project I created an interactive table / .html which allows the user to filter through an extensive list of UFO sightings using 5 different search criteria.

Above is an image of the site. The different search criteria are shown on the left side of the screen.

To perform a search, the user simply needs to enter text into however many of these specific fields and then click return/enter on their keyboard.
An example of a search is shown below.

You can see that there are 4 specific instances of UFO sightings shown in the table when we refine our search to having occured on 1/9/2010 in the us and in the shape of a light. 

## Summary

Some drawbacks / ways to improve the website:

-There is no way to filter search based on duration of sighting (or range of times of duration)
-It would be useful to search for multiple cities, countries, etc. at once
-The only way to know how many results have been retunred by a search is to count them one by one
-There is no way to see how many different states/countries/shapes/etc. there are in these instances. It would be useful to have a drop-down menu of all cities (for example) in which UFO sightings have occured, and be able to refine a search that way
-It would be useful if ther example text disappeared when a search is performed. It can be difficult to distinguish between the two (shown below)

-This search engine is not very friendly for those who struggle with spelling. Further, typing 'united states' rather than 'us' returns no results (same issues present with states/dates)
